merged Fhyp, Fdif, dpe initialization loops (L1, L5, L14)
  for each array component, change first update to an assignment
merged hypterm loops (L2-L4)
  TODO: merge update statements to further increase locality
merged diffterm loops
  fused Q -> dQ/dx loops (L7-L9)
  fused dQ,mu,vsm -> Fdif(imx, imy, imz, iene) loops (L10-L13)
  fused big loops (L16-L21)
    ghost dependency oh Hg: shift bounds and index on dependent loop (i -> i-1) and use if statement to merge
    duplicate Hg into Hgx, Hgy, Hgz so that we can merge all three big loops together, gated with if statements
    working set expands by roughly 2x due to larger tile size (ghost cells in X and Y)
swapped order of hypterm and diffterm and had them update Uprime directly to remove calcU (L23)
merged reset_density into update_rk3 (L24 & L25)
