- black box calculation of D^{-1}
- cubical problem size -> rectahedral problem size ... init problem, restriction rules, etc...
- move removal of constants from solution for poisson w/periodic to end of solver (instead of per v-cycle)
- cycleTime:  uint64_t nanoseconds to double seconds.  cycles.* convert to double
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
